- test_prinfo.c - some additional test-cases.
- Makefile - used for building the system call test code.


===========================
  System Test Call usage:
===========================
./sys_test_prinfo <nr> <buf_size>


===============
  Test Cases:
===============

1. ./sys_test_prinfo 1 0
output - Invalid argument (EINVAL)

2. ./sys_test_prinfo 10 5
output - test process gets an abort signal while trying to perform a malloc just after system call returns

3. ./sys_test_prinfo 6 10
output - test process prints the process tree with 6 processes in it  

4. ./sys_test_prinfo 10 10
output - test process prints the process tree with 10  processes in it  

5. ./sys_test_prinfo 100 100
otuput - test process prints the process tree with 58 processes in it - this happens since there are only 58 running 
	processes

Manual Test Cases:
1. 0x70000 address was passed as the buffer address to the system call and copy to user returned EFAULT
   - this implies that copy to user validates that the address is a user space address and not a kernel space address.
2. We created a hierarchy of processes using multiple forks and validated that the first child pid is the pid of the youngest,
   that is the largest pid of all the children, and the next sibling pid is the pid of the oldest sibling i.e. the least pid of 
   all the siblings

The binary called 'zygote' doesn't exist.

The binary for this process is /system/bin/app_process. It's started as a service ininit.rc in the following way: 'service zygote /system/bin/app_process -Xzygote /system/bin --zygote --start-system-server'. So it starts with the name 'zygote'. As we know, when we call exe
c, we can give any name we want to the child process.

  Notes
=========

1. Although DFS doesnt specify the order in which siblings have to be printed,
   we are printing the younger sibling first.
2. If the process is the oldest sibling then its next sibling pid will be zero since it points to the parent.
